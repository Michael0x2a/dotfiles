# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles and config info

## About

This repo is loosely inspired by [this article][0] by Michael Smalley describing how to use git to manage your dotfiles and various other config files.

I currently do not have any sort of automated symlink system as described in article set up yet -- this repo is currently a raw dump of different dotfiles as I slowly move them over.

Because I develop on both Windows _and_ Linux, I'm still working out how to best maintain feature parity between the two.
